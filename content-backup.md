## About Me

### Short Version (Displayed)

My first encounter with programming was in **Grade 6**, where for our TLE class we were learning about **Scratch**. I vividly remember that for our **Performance Task** we had to create a simple game. _Panic kicked in_ because for that entire quarter, I really didn't pay attention. All I did in class was roam around the Lab Room, annoying my friends. Honestly, I don't remember how I even survived, but I am pretty sure my friend helped me with my game.

### Full Story (Expandable)

It was elementary; I still got a **high grade**, I think. My next encounter with it was the next year, again in our **TLE class**. This time around it was with **HTML and CSS**. The only thing I remember here was asking for help from my **brother** to create my website for the **Performance Task** (literally just plain HTML and just editing the font and color, it looked so ahh).

Then came the actual **"programming."** Yes, to no one's surprise, it is in our TLE class once again. This time it was **C++**. I thought learning **Java** and **Python** was hard as a **1st Year**; imagine teaching C++ to 9th graders during the **pandemic**, where no one paid attention in class. Looking back, I think this was where I had a hunch that I would enjoy coding and CS _(wehh pag sure ba?...)_. I had fun creating our Performance Tasks (very simple **Console GDP calculator**), and while it was stressful, I enjoyed it, seeing a bunch of weird syntax come to life.

Now, fast forward to **Grade 10**, we had **robotics** class. Honestly, that class should have been fun and should have taught me a lot. But my teacher didn't bother teaching anyone anything at all. We did **Arduino**, where we made a bunch of robots (Line Following, **Obstacle Avoidance**, Hand/Sensor Following, **Bluetooth Control**) but I did not learn anything. He just gave us the **code** and left everything to us. But still, I had fun (10% dahil sa **robotics**, 90% dahil sa groupmate eme).

That brings me to the present. I guess I took **Computer Science** because I thought it would be the most fit for me. Ehh, I guess it's not too bad _(my QPI says otherwise)_. **Ateneo** is where I actually learned how to code, from learning the basics in Python to more difficult concepts in **Java**, and I don't even know what's happening in **Data Strucs** but yeah that. Right now, I'm just working on honing my skills in **Web Dev**, mainly with **Next.js** while also working on personal projects. Praying to get a j\*b (or get an internship) soon.

### Raw About Me (from comments)

> Hi, I am Yani. I am studying Bachelor of Science in Staying At The Restaurant With Specialization in Being The Man Who Can't Be Moved at Ateneo de Manila University. I struggle with people pleasing, overthinking, and pretending everything is/will be okay. And my coping mechanisms are self-sabotage, detachment, and isolation.
