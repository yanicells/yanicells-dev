plan
- some parts have “chats” or conversations basically like AI where the user asked a question and respond in markdown format
- so those are my blogs or just random thoughts
- so it is like a saved conversation

finalize plan (md plan, md chatgpt explain pages + modify) add pulsoid monitor heart rate to one of my websites
other data accessible with my watch like sleep or steps
_petalite on twitter
maybe do something like my spotify listening activity
spot listen + receipts
try to graph it also

Basically chatgpt but customize it like having additional UI stuff and assets
- Imitate sidebar
    - Chats (are like blogs or about me)
    - GPTs are my experience, skills, certificates, tech stack
    - Projects
    - Contact ?

And AI tab (say like talk to me in english, bisaya, or tagalog)
Try to add a 2d or 3d of me

assets like this https://vt.tiktok.com/ZS5CH3KhX/ 

since spotify api used a lot, maybe just integrate to this or chika since its more fun and people will use it and have some fun data etc.
