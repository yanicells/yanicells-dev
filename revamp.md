important: add security measures for my api route, specifically the chat, maybe internal rate limits, and some predefined prompts to just click so that it won't generate but just return something predefinied

add pulsoid monitor heart rate 
other data accessible with my watch like sleep or steps
_petalite on twitter
maybe do something like my spotify listening activity
try to graph it also

Basically chatgpt but customize it like having additional UI stuff and assets
- add some fun animations or graphics
- music activity, add vinyl, show now playing spinning, add some spotify stats like top artists, top songs, etc. and even recos

And AI tab (say like talk to me in english, bisaya, or tagalog)
Try to add a 2d or 3d of me

assets like this https://vt.tiktok.com/ZS5CH3KhX/ 

since spotify api used a lot, maybe just integrate to this or chika since its more fun and people will use it and have some fun data etc.

consolidated feats
- update about me for a diff intro (about me content that is shorter)
- discovery is the new about me (the content is the current about me), make use of perplexity discovery ui, each part must link to its separate page
- add similar UI to the Chats area, there is a text, and then those tabs, but there is now icons, these are the pages that are linked to the discovery, this part is called Yani's cells which is before the chats
- Yani's cells include, anime page (currently watching and/or recently watched, add section for like ratings and personal reco, maybe cards that can have some possibility for description for thoughts), music page (currently listening, top songs, artists, reco)
- all those pages in Yani's cells should be displayed in discovery page as separate sections, there would also be a part for a github commit 

(same with contact page - try maybe use discovery page sa perplexity)

chats
add bisaya and tagalog chats make the topic actually appropriate for the language
