plan
- some parts have “chats” or conversations basically like AI where the user asked a question and respond in markdown format
- so those are my blogs or just random thoughts
- so it is like a saved conversation

important: add security measures for my api route, specifically the chat, maybe internal rate limits, and some predefined prompts to just click so that it won't generate but just return something predefinied

add pulsoid monitor heart rate 
other data accessible with my watch like sleep or steps
_petalite on twitter
maybe do something like my spotify listening activity
spot listen + receipts + maybe some albums - songs i want to feature
try to graph it also

Basically chatgpt but customize it like having additional UI stuff and assets
- maybe customize the chatgpt ui to be more personal rather than strict ai look
- add some fun animations or graphics
- Imitate sidebar
    - Chats (are like blogs or about me)
    - GPTs are my experience, skills, certificates, tech stack
    - Projects
    - Contact ?
- music activity, add vinyl, show now playing spinning, add some spotify stats like top artists, top songs, etc. and even recos

And AI tab (say like talk to me in english, bisaya, or tagalog)
Try to add a 2d or 3d of me

assets like this https://vt.tiktok.com/ZS5CH3KhX/ 

since spotify api used a lot, maybe just integrate to this or chika since its more fun and people will use it and have some fun data etc.

AI theme like mostly a copy just some fun details
Improve SEO and add to google search console 
ai meta sam3d for 3d generation from picture

some libraries
- threejs motionjs animejs
- accernity
- some ai chat api
