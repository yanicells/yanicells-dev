important: add security measures for my api route, specifically the chat, maybe internal rate limits, and some predefined prompts to just click so that it won't generate but just return something predefinied

add pulsoid monitor heart rate 
other data accessible with my watch like sleep or steps
_petalite on twitter
maybe do something like my spotify listening activity
spot listen + receipts + maybe some albums - songs i want to feature
try to graph it also

Basically chatgpt but customize it like having additional UI stuff and assets
- add some fun animations or graphics
- music activity, add vinyl, show now playing spinning, add some spotify stats like top artists, top songs, etc. and even recos

And AI tab (say like talk to me in english, bisaya, or tagalog)
Try to add a 2d or 3d of me

assets like this https://vt.tiktok.com/ZS5CH3KhX/ 

since spotify api used a lot, maybe just integrate to this or chika since its more fun and people will use it and have some fun data etc.
