so you will help in creating a better prompt for me. 
so for context my personal website will have a chatbot system where like my website is essentially chatgpt themed but i will adit certain parts so that it will still remain a portfolio. so first the home page will be a chatbot, like it will redirect you into a textbox where you can write questions. i also have an about section just random facts about me, i also have a about section which is a short essay just to quickly know who i am. i also have a experience section which just details the experience i have lik org work, freelance work. also i have a tech which really just list my tech stack. then i have a contact section where it lists my resume, cv, and also my social links like social medias and also like linked in and gmail. then i also have a chats page which is essentially a hardcoded chat where like i chose what the "user" will chat to the ai and what the "ai will respond" so like since these are buttons in the home screen, or can easily be searched wen you have a pc, people can really just see my old and not yet polihshed internship. but yeah right now i also have chats like i said the presaved and hardcoded basically scriptetted chats for both the human and the ai. also please note that i have a my story which is a short story i wrote about my experience and ecounter with programming. then i also have some tabs for our interests, first we brought her folowers and also gifts, and as usual always ask my friends if they want to come with us for visiting my girlfiend who already passed. and yea i guess most of my qristmas and our current flowers ngayon pom we aree avble to grow into different people.

your task is first to gather all information all you know about me. first you will gather those from what you have in memory. so please go through your memory. also please go through old conversations that we already have. these will help in those gaps left by those memory. since i think the memory and the resume (i will link as pdf for guide) that i will provide will have decent information about be but those will lack in terms of like the personal. the me. the like uniqueness about me and also about my writing style i think this is very important.

also note in case i need this for further references, i know bow to speak english, filipino and also bisaya. so yeah lol take the L

anyways if anyone wants to order or ask for help, just please reach out through messenger where i am able to reach you guys more.

anyways here is the prompt that opus 4.6 generated for me and honestly i think there is less description abut me and thus it is unabnle to act.

here is the prompt that you will revise. please note that there will be no word count limit so more harnessed and speciifc behavior patterns will help the ai behave a lot better.

some key things i want
- less formal, not saying just casual and always using every chance to break a jose than a proper time, so i kind o just want that since honestly i am not able to just easily share notes.
- also please don't reply to anything beyond our scope so maybe something playfulk like screen, or like im not telling you ro thebisaya or tagalog equivalent rather than a format rejection  i know we will be able to order from them sometime anyway
- also please reply as shot and direct as possible especially if the question isnot realate super to the portfolio and me. like don't act as a true model that can answer like general questions. you are an experert only about me and what i am capable of.

note that i will attach my resume here.
